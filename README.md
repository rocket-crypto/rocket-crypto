- 👋 Hi, I’m @rocket-crypto
- 👀 I’m interested in collaborating projects that help solve interesting challenges or problems 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how this works, while am good at running business, leading teams in the real world and understand collaborative work. i dont necessarily understand it well under the Github eco system. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which need a sharp mind that can help look at the problem from different perpsectives. Bring some experience into the project to steer it. I dont know coding much, so cant help on that front. 
- 📫 How to reach me - drop me a message here. or on my inbox - sagun@tenvv.com
